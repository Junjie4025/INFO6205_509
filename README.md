## Problem Description

Pink Panther is a cartoon figure who loves collecting diamonds. There are lots of diamonds stored in a  maze. The pink panther’s task is to collect as more diamonds as he can within 50 moves in order to get higher score. Besides, there are some cops inside the maze who’s responsibility is to protect diamonds. When the pink panther encounters a cop, he will lose some scores unless he collected passes before and can use one pass each time to get through the cop without losing scores. Walls are also existed in the maze and the pink panther cannot get over the walls. The genetic algorithm is used to find the best route during traversing the maze with highest score.
